- [x] Implement DELETE /api/events/:eventId/guests/:guestId
- [x] Add request validation
- [x] Write API tests

## Phase 2: Table Assignment Implementation (Week 2)

### 2.1 Table Assignment Logic (2-3 days)
- [x] Implement TableAssignment model/type
- [x] Add validation for seat numbers
- [x] Add capacity checking logic
- [x] Write unit tests for assignment logic

### 2.2 Table Assignment API (2-3 days)
- [x] Implement POST /api/events/:eventId/tables/:tableId/assignments
- [x] Implement GET /api/events/:eventId/tables/:tableId/assignments
- [x] Implement DELETE /api/events/:eventId/tables/:tableId/assignments/:guestId
- [x] Add double-booking prevention
- [x] Write API tests

### 2.3 Assignment Queries (2 days)
- [x] Implement assigned/unassigned guest filtering
- [x] Add database indexes for efficient queries
- [x] Write performance tests

## Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (Week 3)

### 3.1 Integration Testing (2 days)
- [x] Write end-to-end tests
- [x] Test guest management flow
- [x] Test assignment scenarios
- [x] Performance testing

### 3.2 Error Handling (2 days)
- [x] Implement error responses
- [x] Add validation messages
- [x] Improve error feedback
- [x] Test error scenarios

### 3.3 Documentation and Cleanup (2 days)
- [x] API documentation
- [x] Usage examples
- [x] Code cleanup
- [x] Performance optimization

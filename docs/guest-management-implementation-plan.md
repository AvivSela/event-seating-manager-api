## Technical Dependencies

### Backend
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- Database system (existing)
- Jest for testing

### Frontend
- React
- TypeScript
- React Testing Library
- Basic UI component library

## Success Criteria

1. Core Functionality
   - Can create guests with party size
   - Can assign guests to tables
   - Can view assigned/unassigned guests
   - Prevents invalid assignments

2. Performance
   - Guest list loads under 1s
   - Assignment operations complete under 500ms
   - Can handle events with 500+ guests

3. Quality
   - 90% test coverage
   - No critical bugs
   - All validation rules enforced

## Monitoring and Metrics

1. Performance Metrics
   - API response times
   - Query execution times
   - UI rendering performance

2. Error Tracking
   - Failed assignments
   - Validation errors
   - API errors

3. Usage Metrics
   - Number of guests per event
   - Assignment success rate
   - Most common party sizes

## Rollout Plan

1. Internal Testing (Week 4)
   - Team testing
   - Bug fixes
   - Performance optimization

2. Beta Release (Week 5)
   - Limited user group
   - Gather feedback
   - Monitor performance

3. Full Release (Week 6)
   - All users
   - Monitor metrics
   - Support and maintenance

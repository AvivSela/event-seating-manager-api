  │   ├── api/           # Existing API server
  │   │   ├── src/
  │   │   ├── tests/
  │   │   └── package.json
  │   └── web/           # New UI application
  │       ├── src/
  │       ├── tests/
  │       └── package.json
  ├── packages/          # Shared packages
  │   ├── types/        # Shared TypeScript types
  │   │   └── package.json
  │   └── config/       # Shared configurations
  │       └── package.json
  ├── docs/             # Documentation
  ├── .github/          # GitHub workflows
  ├── package.json      # Root package.json
  └── README.md
  ```

### Migration Steps (1 day)

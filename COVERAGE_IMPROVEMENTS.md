- Functions: 98.76%
- Lines: 92%

## Areas Requiring Attention

### 1. Main Application Files
#### index.ts (0% coverage)
- [ ] Add integration tests for server startup
- [ ] Test error handling for server initialization
- [ ] Test port configuration and environment variables
- [ ] Mock and test graceful shutdown handlers

#### logger.ts (0% coverage)
- [ ] Add unit tests for different log levels
- [ ] Test log formatting
- [ ] Test error handling in logging
- [ ] Mock and test file system interactions if file logging is implemented
- [ ] Test logger configuration options

### 2. Controllers

#### TableAssignmentController (85.32% statements, 63.82% branches)
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases in table assignment validation (lines 210, 219)
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid table assignments (lines 236-242)
- [ ] Test concurrent table assignment scenarios
- [ ] Add tests for table capacity validation
- [ ] Test guest reassignment scenarios

#### GuestController (94.44% statements, 90.47% branches)
- [ ] Test error handling for guest creation (line 126)
- [ ] Add tests for guest status updates (line 140)
- [ ] Test guest deletion edge cases (line 169)
- [ ] Test guest lookup with invalid parameters (line 175)

#### VenueController (93.82% statements, 91.11% branches)
- [ ] Test venue creation validation (line 26)
- [ ] Add tests for venue update edge cases (line 115)
- [ ] Test venue deletion scenarios (lines 153-156)
- [ ] Test concurrent venue modifications

#### EventController (97.64% statements, 83.87% branches)
- [ ] Test event date validation (lines 58-59)
- [ ] Add tests for event capacity checks
- [ ] Test event modification with existing guests

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority
1. TableAssignmentController improvements (lowest branch coverage)
2. Main application file coverage (index.ts)
3. Logging utility coverage (logger.ts)

### Medium Priority
1. GuestController edge cases
2. VenueController deletion scenarios
3. EventController date validation

### Low Priority
1. Additional concurrent operation tests
2. Performance edge cases
3. Extended validation scenarios

## Best Practices for New Tests

1. Focus on branch coverage:
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Include edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Test error handling thoroughly

2. Use meaningful test data:
   - Create specific test fixtures for each scenario
   - Use realistic data values
   - Test with both valid and invalid inputs

3. Maintain test independence:
   - Properly setup and teardown test data
   - Avoid test interdependencies
   - Mock external dependencies consistently

4. Document test cases:
   - Clearly describe test scenarios
   - Explain edge cases being tested
   - Document any assumptions made

## Next Steps

1. Start with high-priority items:
   - Implement TableAssignmentController tests first
   - Add basic index.ts coverage
   - Create logger.ts test suite

2. Review and update test helpers:
   - Add new test fixtures as needed
   - Create additional helper functions
   - Update mock data generation

3. Regular coverage monitoring:
   - Run coverage reports after new features
   - Track coverage trends
   - Update this document as improvements are made
